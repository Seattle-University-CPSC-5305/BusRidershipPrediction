# BusRidershipPrediction
This project aims to predict how many Chicago bus riders will use a given route on a given day. The model uses year, month, day type (weekday, weekend, or holiday), and historical weather data to help better predict ridership levels. The goal of this project is to be able to predict ridership so that the needs of CTA bus riders are better met.
